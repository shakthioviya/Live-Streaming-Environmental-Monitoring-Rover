# Live-Streaming-Environmental-Monitoring-Rover
we designed and implemented a multi-functional IoT-enabled rover integrating real-time video streaming, robotic mobility, and environmental sensing. The system leverages the ESP32-CAM platform, providing both control and monitoring via a secure web interface.

ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

Real-time video streaming powered by ESP32-CAM with pan/tilt servo control

Mobility system using L298N motor driver with four DC motors

Environmental monitoring through:

DHT22 â†’ Temperature & Humidity sensing

MQ2 â†’ Gas concentration detection

LM393 â†’ Acoustic level sensing

Web-based dashboard with login authentication for rover control and sensor visualization

Power system designed with a 12V supply and LM2596 buck converter for stable voltage regulation

ðŸ’» Technology Stack

Hardware: ESP32-CAM, L298N H-Bridge, DC motors, servo motors, environmental sensors

Software: C++ (Arduino), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI & API integration)

Networking: Wi-Fi enabled HTTP server for control and data streaming
